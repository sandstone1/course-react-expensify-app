import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import uuid                             from  'uuid';

// combineReducers is going to allow us to create multiple functions that
// define how a redux applicaton changes
// for redux-101.js, one reducer was fine since we were not tracking a
// whole lot of data
// we will learn how to use combineReducers to create multiple smaller
// functions and then combine them together

// let's look at the final state and what we are trying to build
// create a static object that represents the various things we want
// to keep track of

// all the data below is what we need to track in order to create
// a real world expense tracking application
const demoState = {
    // create an expenses array and as we add expenses they will be
    // added as objects inside the array

    // we will have multiple expenses for this application so we will
    // have multiple objects for this array
    expenses : [{
        // id will be randomly generated for us later but for now we
        // will use a random string of characters
        id          : 'adsaskg',
        description : 'January Rent',
        note        : 'That was the final payment to that address',
        // amount we paid in pennies and using pennies makes it easier
        // to calculate numbers
        amount      : 54500,
        // lastly, track the timestamp as to when this expense was
        // created but for now use the number 0
        createdAt   : 0
    }],
    // we will need to filter data by date, by amount, by a date range
    // or search for them by a text value
    // to allow for all of the above, we will use filter below
    // filter will be an object and on this object we will store the
    // current value for a few filters
    filters : {
        // will allow users to filter by text
        text      : 'rent',
        // also going to allow users to pick how they want to sort the
        // expenses they are viewing when they are on the dashboard page
        sortBy    : 'amount', // could date or amount
        // now allow users to filter by a date range
        // we will only show expenses whose createAt property falls in
        // between startDate and endDate
        startDate : undefined,
        endDate   : undefined
    }
};

// in the next video, we will learn how to use combineReducers to write
// reducers for this complex state







// lecture 92: Working with Multiple Reducers

// in this video, we are going to learn how to use combine reducers to
// create redux stores that use multiple reducers as opposed to one
// big one

// the technique in principal is going to be exactly the same as before
// a list of all the action we are going to need to create:
// ADD_EXPENSE for the expense array
// REMOVE_EXPENSE for the expense array
// EDIT_EXPENSE for the expense array
// SET_TEXT_FILTER for the filter array
// SORT_BY_DATE for the filter array
// SORT_BY_AMOUNT for the filter array
// SET_START_DATE for the filter array
// SET_END_DATE for the filter array

// setting up all these actions and handling them with a single reducer
// is just not feasible so we are going to learn how we can break up the
// application into multiple reducers

// we are going to use a single reducer for each root property in our
// redux store and the two root properties in the demoState above are
// expenses and filter so we are going to create two reducers, one for
// expenses and another for filter and we are then going to take those
// 2 reducers and combine them together to create the complete redux store

// so we are going to create a store that has 2 reducers associated with it

// EXPENSES REDUCER
// pass in the 2 arguments: state and action and return the new state
// the default state value will be an empty array and we can create a
// variable for our default state value
const expensesReducerDefaultState = [];

const expensesReducer = ( state = expensesReducerDefaultState, action ) => {
    // we will switch what we do based off a particular value
    switch ( action.type ) {
        // inside the {} we can define the various cases we want to handle
        // -- Mark 3 --
        case 'ADD_EXPENSE':
            // here we want to run some code that adds the expense onto the array
            // don't want to use state.push( action.expense ) since push will change
            // the original array and we want to avoid this so we will use
            // state.concat( action.expense ) since this takes the state array and combines
            // it with action.expense to create a new array and we return this array
            /*
            return state.concat( action.expense );
            */
            // in the console, this results in:
            // {expenses: Array(1), filters: {â€¦}}
                // expenses: Array(1)
                    // 0:
                        // amount: 100
                        // createdAt: 0
                        // description: "Rent"

            // SPREAD OPERATOR
            // now the above works but we want to explore the ES6 spread operator and
            // this allows us to get the same thing done and more
            // as an example, const names = [ 'Andrew', 'Steve' ];
            // if I use the spread operator or [ ...names  ], the result is [ 'Andrew', 'Steve' ]
            // if I want to add an item onto the names array and return a new array, I do as
            // follows [ ...names, 'Mike' ] and the result is [ 'Andrew', 'Steve', 'Mike' ]
            // the great thing here is the spread operator did not change the names array
            // could do [ 'Adam', ...names, 'Mike' ] and the result is [ 'Adam', Andrew', 'Steve', 'Mike' ]
            // so instead of doing this " return state.concat( action.expense ); ", were going to do
            // return [ ...state, action.expense ]; ( so were taking the current state array and addng
            // on the action.expense object without changing the state array )

const store = createStore( expensesReducer );

// test to see if the store is working by testing the default state value and can
// do this by using the getState method
// the result is an empty array or []
console.log( store.getState() );
*/

// combineReducers let's you combine multiple reducers to create a single store and
// using combineReducers is pretty simple, we provide the conbineReducers() as
// the first argument to createStore and call it as a function so the code would
// look as follows:
const store = createStore(
    // combineReducers also takes an argument and the argument will be an object and
    // the object will have key value pairs
    // the key will be the root state name ( i.e. expenses, filter ) and the value
    // will be the reducer that is suppose to manage the key name

    // below we call combineReducers passing the return value into createStore
    // and on the combineReducers object is where we define what we want our
    // redux store to look like
    // so instead of being just an array, we have an object with 2 properties:
    // expenses and filters
    combineReducers({
        // the expenses property is managed by the reducer or the expensesReducer
        expenses : expensesReducer,
        // the filters property is managed by the reducer or the filtersReducer
        // -- Mark 1 --
        filters : filtersReducer
    })
);

// by doing the above, the redux store is an object with a property named expenses
// and that property's value is where the array lives, which is what we want
// so expenses is a property on the root object and this will allow us to build more
// complex redux stores

// test to see if the store is working and we can do this by using the getState method
// console.log( store.getState() );

// challange
// create a second reducer and register it just like we registered the expensesReducer
// go to -- Mark 1 -- above since this code needs to come before the store

// lecture recap
// at this point, we know how to set up the basic store but we don't know how to
// dispatch things like actions correctly 
// in other words, how do we have the expenses reducer respond to a specific action
// and how do we have the filters reducer respond to a specific action





// lecture 93: ES6 Spread Operator in Reducers

// in this video, we will start dispatching actions and handling those actions
// in the appropriate reducer and to do this we will be exploring a very handy
// ES6 tool, which is the ES6 spread operator and it is going to make it a lot
// easier to work with arrays and objects

// a list of all the action we are going to need to create:

// ==============================
// ACTION GENERATOR #1
// ==============================

// ADD_EXPENSE for the expense array

// STEP 1: CREATE THE ADD EXPENSE ACTION GENERATOR

// we are going to start off with the add expense action generator
// we will implicitly return the action object below

// -- Mark 2 --
// we will destructure the first argument and if it doesn't exist we will destructure
// an empty object
// we can define all the things we want within the first {} within the argument
// we want the user to provide the value for description and note but if the user
// does not provide a value then an empty string will surfice
// next up, we default the amount to an appropriate value like 0
// next up, we default the createdAt to an appropriate value like 0 until we talk about
// timestamps
const addExpense = (
    { 
        description = '',
        note        = '',
        amount      = 0,
        createdAt   = 0
    } = {} 
) => ( {
    type : 'ADD_EXPENSE',
    // the expense object will contain all the fields we need,
    // such as id, description, note, amount and createdAt, the last 4 fields
    // are going to come from the user and the id will be generated by our code

    // to generate a random id we will use the NPM UUID library and all we have to
    // do is install it and call the function and we'll be able to generate those IDs
    // however, later on, the IDs will come from the database
    
    // STEP 1: install NPM UUID: I USED NPM HERE INSTEAD OF YARN and in the terminal typed
    // "npm install uuid@3.1.0" but could have used "yarn add uuid@3.1.0"
    // STEP 2: after it is installed, restart the dev server by typing yarn run dev-server
    // STEP 3: next, we need to import the uuid library and there is a single default export
    // we need for this library and type " import uuid from 'uuid'; "
    // STEP 4: next we just call uuid within the expense object to generate a random id,
    // please see below

    // since the other 4 fields are generated by the user, we will pass those fields in
    // as an argument to the arrow function above, go to -- Mark 2 -- above
    expense : {
        id : uuid(),
        // we are using the property shorthand below
        description, // description = description
        note,        // note        = note
        amount,      // amount      = amount
        createdAt    // createdAt   = createdAt
    }
} );

// STEP 2: TRACK CHANGES TO THE ADD EXPENSE ACTION GENERATOR

/*
// now that addExpense generator is set up, we can go ahead and add an expense
// use store.subscribe to track changes and move console.log( store.getState() );
// inside store.subscribe to make sure everytime store.subscribe runs we get
// notified of the changes
store.subscribe( () => {
    console.log( store.getState() );
});
*/

// STEP 3: DISPATCH THE ADD EXPENSE ACTION GENERATOR
// remember to pass an object into the addExpense generator
store.dispatch( addExpense( { description : 'Rent', amount : 100  } ) );

// question: how do we handle this dispatched action when we have mulpiple reducers
// in the redux store?
// answer: the dispatched action will get dispatched to both the expensesReducer and
// the filtersReducer

// when addExpense gets dispatched we set up the case when the reducer needs to do something
// for the expensesReducer, we need to do something (i.e. we need to add the expense to the
// array) when AddExpense get dispatched so set up a case for the AddExpense action generator
// and go to -- Mark 3 --
// for the fitersReducer, we do not need to do anything since AddExpense does not affect the
// data within the filtersReducerDefaultState so we do not set up a case for the addExpense
// action generator

// STEP 4: HANDLE THE ADD EXPENSE ACTION GENERATOR IN THE EXPENSES REDUCER
// -- Mark 4 --
// now we could go ahead and add multiple dispatch expenses by adding multiple dispatch calls
store.dispatch( addExpense( { description : 'Coffee', amount : 300  } ) );
// in the console, this results in:
// {expenses: Array(2), filters: {â€¦}}
    // expenses: Array(2)
        // 0:
            // amount: 100
            // createdAt: 0
            // description: "Rent"
            // id: "17936262-c868-46c6-b1ed-1ab217f671c2"
            // note: ""
        // 1:
            // amount: 300

// go to -- Mark 5 --

// recap video: in this video, we explored the spread operator when working with arrays
// in the next lecture we are going to explore how we can use the spread operator when
// working with objects and this will make it much easier to handle the remaining action
// generators




// lecture 94: Spreading Objects

// in this video, we will look at the object spread operator and the object spread
// operator is more useful than the array spread operator, in the instructor's opinion

// with the array spread operator, you could use concat instead but with the object
// spread operator there really is no substitute

// in prinicpal the object spread operator does the same thing but it's the details that
// are different
// the array spread operator allows us to grab items from an existing array and create a
// new array
// the object spread operator allows us to grab items from an existing object and create a
// a new object
// for example:
const user = {
    name : 'Jen',
    age  : 24
};

// so now we want to create a new object without changing the user object and to do
// this we are going to use the spread operator or ...user to spread out the user
// object

// in the example below we are going to have 2 properties named name and age
// remember, the array spread operator has made it's way into mainstream but the
// the object spread operator is on its way but not quite there yet so we are going
// to have to customize our babel configuration in order to support this syntax

// find appropriate plug in by googling " babel object spread operator " and the
// plug in is called proposal-object-rest-spread but old plug in, at the time the course
// was uploaded, was called transform-object-rest-spread

// #16
// transform-object-rest-spread: I USED NPM HERE INSTEAD OF YARN and typed
// "npm install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread@6.23.0" but could have used
// "yarn add babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread@@6.23.0" and we will install it
// locally and then configure the plugin in .babelrc
// in .babelrc we add the following:
//  {
//      "plugins": ["transform-object-rest-spread"]
//  }
// lecture 94: Spreading Objects

console.log( { ...user } );

// can also add key value pairs to ...user
// results in " { name: "Jen", age: 24, location: "Philadelphia" } "
console.log( {
    ...user,
    location : 'Philadelphia'
 });

// if we add age : 27 then that will override age : 24 in the user object
// results in " { name: "Jen", age: 27, location: "Philadelphia" } "
 console.log( {
    ...user,
    location : 'Philadelphia',
    age      : 27
 });

 // if we add age : 27 before ...user then age : 24 will override age : 27
// results in " { age: 24, name: "Jen", location: "Philadelphia" } "
console.log( {
    age : 27,    
    ...user,
    location : 'Philadelphia'
});

// this is useful because just like we don't want to change the state array
// we also don't want to change the objects that make up our redux store instead
// we just want to clone the objects and add or override various values

// were going to use the object spread operator to give us the ability to edit
// an expense
// so we want the user to be able to override /change description, note, amount and
// createdAt -> see the addExpense action generator above


// EDIT_EXPENSE for the expense array


// ==============================
// ACTION GENERATOR #3

// STEP 2: DISPATCH THE ACTION GENERATOR FOR EDIT EXPENSE

// were going to pass in the necessary information to editExpense()
// what details do we need to give editExpense? Two things, (1) we need the ID of
// the expense were trying to edit and (2) we need what were trying to edit
// so we can pass in the ID and what were trying to edit or we pass in 2 arguments,
// the first one will be the ID and the second one will be the updater object and
// this object will update description, note, amount and createdAt
// for our example, we will just update the amount right now (remember, amount is 
// in pennies )
